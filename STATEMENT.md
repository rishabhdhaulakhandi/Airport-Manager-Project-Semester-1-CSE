Project Statement: Airport Management System (AMS)
Problem Statement
Airport operations involve managing a high volume of structured data across various departments, including personnel, flights, and customer records. A lack of a unified, administrative interface for data entry and basic report generation can lead to data inconsistencies and inefficient management overhead. The objective is to build a basic, robust system to centralize the creation, storage (simulated), and retrieval of these core airport entities, providing administrators with immediate, formatted access to operational data and simple analytics (like salary reports).
Scope of the Project
The scope of the Airport Management System (AMS) is limited to the data management of four primary entity sets within the airport.
In Scope:
•	CRUD Operations: Full data manipulation capability for Airlines, Flights, Passengers, and Employees.
•	Authentication: Mandatory login procedure for administrative access.
•	Basic Analytics: Calculation of Min, Max, and Average salary for employees.
•	User Interface: Menu-driven Console Line Interface (CLI) for interaction.
Out of Scope (Future Enhancements):
•	Permanent data storage (e.g., database integration).
•	Real-time flight tracking or external API integration.
•	Complex resource allocation algorithms (e.g., intelligent gate scheduling).
•	Handling multiple user roles or advanced permissions.
Target Users
1.	Airport Administrators/Supervisors: Primary users responsible for data entry, removal, and overall management of airport data entities.
2.	HR/Finance Personnel: Secondary users who utilize the Employee module to run salary reports and manage staff records.
High-Level Features
•	Secure CLI Login with failure limits.
•	Modular data management for Airlines, Flights, Passengers, and Employees.
•	Robust input validation for user prompts.
•	Formatted tabular data display using Python's tabulate.
